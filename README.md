# AHK_imgSearcher

Mini tool with simple GUI to help you with AHK's ImageSearch option.

Created to check if your image is searchable - just type image's full path (1) - if it can't find .bmp on screen, you can add *n value (2) or custom screen resolution (3).
Remember to use images in .bmp format, saved directly from Paint.
